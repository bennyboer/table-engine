<h1>1. Introduction</h1>
<p>
    The Table Engine is a <i>JavaScript/TypeScript</i> library to visualize any kind of table - that means you can use it to
    create spreadsheets applications like Excel or visualizations for data (so-called data grids).
    In contrast to other libraries, we do not focus on a particular use-case.
    Additionally, since the rendering is not backed by the DOM but rather by a canvas element, it is comparatively
    <strong>memory-efficient</strong> and <strong>fast</strong>.
    Numerous features that you would only get for a lot of money at the competition, such as virtual scrolling for rows
    and columns, are available out-of-the-box without any further configuration.
    Since this library is open source licensed under the <strong>MIT-license</strong>, you can get it free of charge.

<h2>Small demo</h2>
<p>
    Below you'll find a small demonstration of the Table Library.
    Keep in mind that the row and column headers are optional as is pretty much everything!
    How your table looks like and what capabilities it will have is entirely up to you.

<h2>What is a table?</h2>
<p>
    The goal of this library is to be able to render any kind of table with good performance - no matter the structure or data.
    So, what exactly is a table? A table is data structured in rows and columns, often paired with a description of the row or column in the first row respectively column, called "headers".
    Moreover, the individual data to be displayed in a single cell might span multiple rows and/or columns.
    We call this a "merged cell".
    Since only having data arranged in rows and columns does not make for a visual pleasing result, most tables have borders between adjacent rows and columns to separate them visually.
    Save for some more advanced features, this is basically a table!
    It sounds easy, but under the hood there are some pretty finicky algorithms needed to perform as you would expect it.
    The Table Engine will ensure you can concentrate on the fun part.
