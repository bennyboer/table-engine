<h1>1. Introduction</h1>

<p>
    The Table Engine is a JavaScript/TypeScript library to visualize any kind of table - that means you can use it to
    create spreadsheets applications like Excel or visualizations for data (so-called data grids).
    In contrast to other libraries, we do not focus on a particular use-case.
    Additionally, since the rendering is not backed by the DOM but rather by a canvas element, it is comparatively
    memory-efficient and fast.
    Numerous features that you would only get for a lot of money at the competition, such as virtual scrolling for rows
    and columns, are available out-of-the-box without any further configuration.
    Since this library is open source licensed under the MIT-license, you can get it free of charge.

<h2>Small demo</h2>

<p>
    Below you'll find a small demonstration of the Table Library.
    Keep in mind that the row and column headers are optional as is pretty much everything!
    How your table looks like and what capabilities it will have is entirely up to you.

<div #tableContainer class='table-container'></div>
