<h1>3. Cell renderer</h1>
<p>
    The Table Engine itself does not care at all what is displayed inside a cell.
    It will only provide the constraints like the cell size, position and value.
    To actually render the cells value however you like, we need another concept: <strong>Cell renderers</strong>.
</p>

<h2>Predefined cell renderers</h2>
<p>
    There are a lot of common things to be displayed in a table.
    You do not have to reinvent the wheel by using <strong>predefined</strong> cell renderers that are distributed with the Table Engine library.
    We have listed some of the predefined renderers in the below table where you can interactively see what they are capable of.
</p>

<div #tableContainer class='table-container'></div>

<blockquote>
    A note of caution here regarding the <strong>DOM cell renderer</strong>.
    The library is capable of rendering HTML elements of any kind inside cells of the table.
    This works, but is to be used as a last resort since you are impeding rendering performance that way.
    The library has been developed using a HTML5 canvas element instead of rendering a HTML table using the DOM and you should use it that way whenever possible to ensure best user experience.
    So only use the DOM renderer if you are absolutely sure you cannot write a custom cell renderer that will do for your use-case.
</blockquote>

<p>
    Most of the time you are good to go with the predefined cell renderers.
    Only in extraordinary use-cases you might want to dive into writing your own cell renderer implementation.
    If you feel like we missed a pretty common type of cell renderer, feel free to either open an issue in our <a href='https://github.com/bennyboer/table-engine' target='_blank'>GitHub repository</a> or try to implement it and open a pull request so we can review it and add to the Table Engine for general availability!
    The same is valid for any kind of bug or strange behavior you encounter.
    Even if you just feel like there is some configuration of the cell renderers missing that you would like to be configurable.
</p>

<h2>Registering a cell renderer</h2>
<p>
    Before you can use predefined or custom-made cell renderer you need to register it at the <code>TableEngine</code> instance, so that the Table Engine is aware of it.
    This is done by simply calling <code>TableEngine.registerCellRenderer(...)</code> with your desired cell renderer instance as parameter as shown in the below example.
</p>

<pre><code [highlight]='codeSamples.registerCellRenderer' [languages]="['typescript']" [lineNumbers]='true'></code></pre>

<p>
    In the example we register a lot of predefined cell renderers.
    The process is the same no matter if the renderer is predefined or custom-made.
    For the first registered cell renderer, which is the text cell renderer, we pass centered horizontal alignment as default configuration.
    That means, that every text cell renderer will render its text centered by default.
    Passing default configuration is possible for any predefined cell renderer.
</p>

<h2>Using a cell renderer for a cell</h2>
<p>
    Using a cell renderer for a cell has mostly been covered.
    When adding cells to the cell model, you are able to define the name of the cell renderer for each cell.
    The predefined cell renderers have a constant name.
    For example the text cell renderers name can be accessed using <code>TextCellRenderer.NAME</code>.
    In the below code snippet you will find the code used to use the DOM cell renderer in the above table example.
</p>

<pre><code [highlight]='codeSamples.usingCellRenderer' [languages]="['typescript']" [lineNumbers]='true'></code></pre>

<h2>Implementing a custom cell renderer</h2>
<p>
    Implementing a custom cell renderer is not really a difficult task, but you have a lot of responsibility because you can draw basically everywhere on the table.
    The Table Engine will not really check after what your cell renderer is doing.
</p>

<p>
    Start by implementing a new class for your cell renderer that will implement the <code>ICanvasCellRenderer</code> interface - we can call it <code>ExampleCellRenderer</code> for now!
</p>

<pre><code [highlight]='codeSamples.exampleCellRendererStart' [languages]="['typescript']" [lineNumbers]='true'></code></pre>

<p>
    Next we will go over what the different methods you need to implement have to do:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <code>after</code>: this method is called when all cells that need to be rendered with this cell renderer have been rendered in a rendering cycle.
        You don't need to do anything if there is nothing to be done.
        This can be useful to clean up the canvas rendering context that you're using to render the cells content on the tables canvas.
        For now leave the method body empty as it is.
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>before</code>: similar to the <code>after</code> method this can be used to initialize the cell renderer for another rendering cycle - before rendering all cells that need to be rendered with the custom cell renderer.
        You can leave it empty for now.
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>cleanup</code>: the cleanup method is called when there are no more cells in the current viewport that can be rendered with the new cell renderer.
        If you don't need to do something here - leave it empty.
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>estimatePreferredSize</code>: when double-clicking row or column resizers (small space between row- and column-headers when having resizing enabled) the Table Engine is trying to estimate a row or column size that is fitting all visible content.
        Each cell renderer can give a preferred size if there is any using this method.
        If your cell renderer is for example just displaying something based on the size of the cell, you probably don't have a preferred size and can just return <code>null</code> here.
        The checkbox cell renderer for example is responding with the size of the last rendered checkbox + label.
        For now just return <code>null</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>getCopyValue</code>: when the user is pressing Ctrl+C to copy the cell values of the currently selected cells, this method is called for each cell renderer that has a cell in the selection.
        It is responsible for returning a string or a HTML string that is a suitable representation for the value to copy.
        The text cell renderer for example is just responding with the cells text value, while the DOM cell renderer is returning the HTML to be displayed.
        It is not essentials that this works and you can just for now return an empty string.
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>getEventListener</code>: since the Table Engines cells are not elements in the DOM you cannot simply register an event listener on them.
        Sometimes you need to react on events like the row/column header cell renderer when the mouse is hovered over a cell for example or the text cell renderer is double clicked to show an input field when editable.
        This can be done by returning an instance of the <code>ICellRendererEventListener</code> interface.
        We will use this later in the <code>ExampleCellRenderer</code> implementation - for now just return <code>null</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>getName</code>: every cell renderer must have a name so that you can use it in the cell definition to assign a cell renderer to a cell.
        Just return an unique value like <code>"EXAMPLE"</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>initialize</code>: when the Table Engine is initialized, the cell renderes are supplied with the <code>TableEngine</code> instance here.
        This is needed because cell renderers sometimes need to have access to the Table Engines properties, such as the cell model.
        For example the row/column header cell renderer is changing a cells background color when the mouse is hovered above it and thus needs to trigger another Table repaint using <code>TableEngine.repaint()</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>onDisappearing</code>: sometimes cell renderers use the so-called viewport cache to cache results from previous rendering cycles to speed up rendering.
        For example the text cell renderer is caching the line wrap result so that is only needs to be recalculated once the width of the column changes.
        To use the viewport cache each cell instance that is passed to the cell renderer has a <code>viewportCache</code> field of type <code>any</code>.
        Every cell renderer is responsible for using and managing that property - no one else is allowed to tinker with it with one exception: the Table Engine will clear the viewport cache once the cell goes out of viewport and will not be rendered anymore - hence the name viewport cache.
        The <code>onDisappearing</code> method will be called once a cell that is rendered with the cell renderer goes out of viewport.
        Afterwards the viewport cache is cleared automatically by the Table Engine - you don't have to do that in the <code>onDisappearing</code> method.
        For example the DOM cell renderer is using this method to remove the DOM element that it is rendering from the DOM.
        For this example cell renderer we won't need to do anything here and can leave the body empty.
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>render</code>: the render method is the core of any cell renderer.
        It is responsible for actually rendering the cells value on the tables canvas.
        Thus the <code>CanvasRenderingContext2D</code>, cell instance and cell bounds are passed as method parameters.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    For the example cell renderer we want to draw a simple rectangle in the cell.
    In the following code block you'll find the render method.
</p>

<pre><code [highlight]='codeSamples.exampleCellRendererRenderMethod' [languages]="['typescript']" [lineNumbers]='true'></code></pre>

<p>
    Now you can use it to draw red rectangles in any cell!
    Below you'll find the result when using the cell renderer in an example for the cell at row 2 and column 2.

<p>
    You should by now be prepared to write custom cell renderers - probably more complex than the example cell renderer above!
    For more advanced examples you may want to check the source code of the predefined cell renderers in the Table Engine <a href='https://github.com/bennyboer/table-engine/tree/main/src/renderer/canvas/cell' target='_blank'>GitHub repository</a> - especially the <a href='https://github.com/bennyboer/table-engine/blob/main/src/renderer/canvas/cell/rating/rating-cell-renderer.ts' target='_blank'>rating cell renderer</a> is a recommended read!
