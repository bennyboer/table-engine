<h1>4. Cell model</h1>

<p>
    We have already dealt with the cell model in previous sections of this guide.
    Now we want to give a more detailed look at it.
</p>

<p>
    The Table Engine cell model is responsible for managing the row/column structure of a table and its integrity.
    Additionally it provides a set of tools to modify a table:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Inserting/deleting rows/columns:</strong>
        With the methods <code>insertRows</code>, <code>insertColumns</code>, <code>deleteRows</code> and <code>deleteColumns</code> you're able to insert or delete rows or columns where you want.
        The cell model is able to change merged cells accordingly - for example when row is inserted in between a merged cell.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Hiding/showing rows/columns:</strong>
        For some use-cases you might want to hide rows/columns - for example when developing a spreadsheet application like Excel.
        The Table Engines cell model has got you covered with the methods <code>hideRows</code>, <code>hideColumns</code>, <code>showRows</code>, <code>showColumns</code> and <code>showAll</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Resizing rows/columns:</strong>
        Maybe surprising, but the cell model also is responsible for resizing rows and columns using the methods <code>resizeRows</code> and <code>resizeColumns</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Merging/splitting cells:</strong>
        Using <code>mergeCells</code> and <code>splitCell</code> you can either merge a range of cells together or split a merged cell again into its parts.
        You most likely know this kind of feature from spreadsheet applications like Excel.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Managing cell values and renderers:</strong>
        If you want to change a cells value or its renderer you can use the methods <code>setValue</code> and <code>setRenderer</code>.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Keep in mind that when using any of these methods the Table Engine is not automatically informed after initialization.
    That means that when changing a cells value for example the Table Engine needs to be repainted using <code>TableEngine.repaint()</code>.
    We've chosen a manual repainting approach because we cannot know whether the developer wants to perform a single or multiple actions on the cell model.
    When performing multiple actions it would waste resources repainting the table after each action.
