<h1>6. Borders</h1>

<p>
    If there is a cell model and a selection model, might there even be a border model for managing borders in the table?
    Yes, absolutely!
</p>

<h2>What is a border?</h2>

<p>
    A border is a colorful line that is used to visually separate cells.
    You can choose between different border sizes (or thicknesses), colors and styles (solid, dotted, dashed).
    What is important: borders only have a visual effect, they do not affect row/column or cell sizes.
</p>

<h2>Setting a border</h2>

<p>
    You can access the <code>BorderModel</code> using <code>TableEngine.getBorderModel</code>.
    There are basically two options available: Either set a border to a whole cell range with <code>setBorder</code>, or use the easier method <code>setBorderLine</code> to set a single border line to a cell based on a mask like in the following example.
</p>

<pre><code [highlight]='codeSamples.setBorderLine' [languages]="['typescript']" [lineNumbers]='true'></code></pre>

<p>
    In the above example we set a dotted border of size (or thickness) 3 with the given color at row 10 and column 2 at the top and bottom.
    That is pretty much everything that is to say about the border model at a high level.
