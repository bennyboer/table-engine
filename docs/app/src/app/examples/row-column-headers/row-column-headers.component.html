<h1>Row/column headers</h1>

<p>
    Row and column headers are a kind of cell content that describe a row/column.
    In the context of a spreadsheet-application columns may be labeled alphabetically with "A", "B", ..., "Z", ..., "AA", ... while rows are simply increasing numbers.
    When developing a table as data visualization rows and column headers need to convey more meaning to the rows or columns data they are heading.
    For example when visualizing a customer database where each customer has a name, a phone number, a mail address, etc.
    Those are exactly the column headers you'll want to give.

<p>
    So far so good. Now, how to do these things with the Table Engine.
    The library does not really care for what you want to display - you simply can display anything you want.
    For row/column headers in the context of a spreadsheet-application there is already a predefined cell renderer called the <code>RowColumnHeaderRenderer</code> that will number columns alphabetically and rows numerically (See example A).
    When using the Table Engine to develop a data visualization where you can filter and sort using row/column headers, you'll want to check out example B.

<h2>Example A: spreadsheet-like headers</h2>

<p>
    For spreadsheet-like row/column headers we are going to use the predefined <code>RowColumnHeaderRenderer</code>.
    Normally when scrolling the row/column headers would not disappear but rather stay fixed at their position so you can even see them when scrolling to the end of the table.
    To fix that behavior we can use fixed rows/columns by setting the option <code>engine.getOptions().renderer.view.fixedRows</code> and <code>engine.getOptions().renderer.view.fixedColumns</code> to <code>1</code> before initializing the Table Engine.
    Additionally since only using the cell renderer would not change selection logic, we can still select the row/column headers without the whole row or column selected as well - like we probably are used to when already having used Excel or another spreadsheet application.
    To change selection behavior we can use a predefined selection transform <code>ROW_COLUMN_HEADER_TRANSFORM</code> that can be assigned to <code>engine.getOptions().selection.selectionTransform</code>.
    The result can be seen below!

<h2>Example B: data visualization headers</h2>

<p>
    The cell renderer for this is not yet developed.
    You may consider developing one yourself.
